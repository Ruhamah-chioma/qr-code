### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I learnt how to add font styles using google font using a link.

The code on how to add font sytle using a link is below
```html
 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
:root {
   --outfit: "Outfit", sans-serif 
} 
```
```
I also learnt more about semantic HTML tags

### Continued development

In future projects, I will like to get better at making my project responsive.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1]( [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)) - This helped me with choosing a nice font style. 
- [resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand semantic HTML tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
